Used the 'glove.6B.300d' embedding file to generate embeddings of words of the blog texts of every Author and used Sequential Model to predict the Age class of the Author. 
Performed Statistical Analysis on the meta information of each blog post namely, topics, zodiac signs of the authors, gender and age groups. 

Built a rule based Chatbot using Sequential Model from a json file of User Patterns, Intents and the relevant responses.
